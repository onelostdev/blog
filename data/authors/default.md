I'm just a lost developer finding a way. I don't have great ambitions in life as long as I have what I need. I'm a young developer
trying to build something by himself, may this blog be the beggining of something great. 

I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science, and a lot of training in different aspects of software developing (FullStack, DevOps, SRE, Backend).

**If you need an App to be developed, don't hesitate in contacting me**
