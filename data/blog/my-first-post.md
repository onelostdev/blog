## The beggining of a journey

Hey dear reader, I don't know how or why you got here, but let me introduce myself. 

I'm just a lost developer trying something out. I feel like I have tossed up so many projects 
that the only way to keep going until the end is that I have to share it with someone. I need something 
to pull me out of the routine I'm living. One of my biggest concerts is my professional career, I don't really
know where I'm headed. 

Some of my biggest passions in software developing are working with Kubernetes, CI/CD, DevOps... So basically I'm going
the SRE route. But I also love developing Apps, working in backend and frontend, even though my UX/UI skills are pretty lacking.
So should I go the Full-Stack route? 

I'm currently working as a researcher in an University, it was fun in the beggining while developing apps that improved the efficiency
of the research project I was assigned on. But I hate writing down all the results and explain them in a *beautiful* way. But that's work I guess.

*Hmmmm..* I actually don't know. What I'd really like is to start my own thing, not depending of any big entity to survive. 

### *So what to expect from these posts?* 

Expect anything, maybe some are going to be random rambles likes this one about my thoughts on some random topic. There also might
be some random **Tutorial** about deploying, developing or debugging apps/selfhosted apps. 

I know things look a little rough right now but things will evolve/change, and I hope to evolve with it in this process and become 
who I'm supposed to be.
